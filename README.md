Teep is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Vicki Tan

Time spent: 20 hours in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* Custom font
* UI animations
* Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.


## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
